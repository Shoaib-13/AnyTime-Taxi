# AnyTime-Taxi
"ANY TIME TAXI" aims to book the taxis at all the fare charges. Manual system that is employed is extremely laborious and quite inadequate. It only makes the process more difficult and hard. The aim of our project is to develop a system that is meant to partially computerize the work performed in the prepaid taxi management system like generating monthly daily bookings, record of routes available , fare charges of every route; store record of the customer.

The project ‘Any Time Taxi’ is based on the database, object oriented and networking techniques. As there are many areas where we keep the records in database for which we are using MY SQL software which is one of the best and the easiest software to keep our information. This project uses PHP as the front-end software which is an Object Oriented Programming and has connectivity with MY SQL.

Any Time Taxi Software is a web based platform that allows customers to book their taxis all online from the comfort of their own home or office. Bookings can be made through the Any Time Taxi site or by the phone call.

The platform offers an administration interface where the taxi company can manage the content, and access all bookings and customer information. More and more Taxi companies are looking for integrating Any Time Taxis as it makes life much easier for,

a). the customer - this is highly important and in today's internet age, people should be able to book taxis online without having to         pick up the phone and,

b). the taxi company - as all their bookings are now managed via an automated system which means they have an electronic record of            future and historic bookings.

From the historic data the taxi firm will be able to look at booking trends of set periods of time, and future bookings will allow them to budget their staff and taxi routes accordingly.

The objective of the AnyTime Taxi Project is :

1. Any Time Taxi is very helpful for user; user can search the taxi according to his/her needs and book the taxi.

2. Keeping track of all the activities and their records on paper is very cumbersome and error prone. It also is very inefficient and a      time-consuming process. Observing the continuous increase in population and number of people booking taxi, recording and maintaining      all these records is highly unreliable, inefficient and error-prone. It is also not economically & technically feasible to maintain       these records on paper. Thus keeping the working of the manual system as the basis of our project. We have developed an automated         version of the manual system, named as “Any Time Taxi”.

3. The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less Easy Cab up to 90%. It also aims at providing low-cost reliable automation of      the existing systems.
